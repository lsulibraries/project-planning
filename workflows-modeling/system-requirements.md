# System requirements

In nearly everyone's [responses](https://github.com/lsulibraries/project-planning/tree/master/workflows-modeling/responses/) and in our meetings, there has been discussion of software systems that would help the overall system run smoothly.

## System functions / facets / aspects

Between them, [Cara](https://github.com/lsulibraries/project-planning/blob/master/workflows-modeling/responses/phase-2/phase-2-cara.md#common-themes) and [Mike](https://github.com/lsulibraries/project-planning/blob/master/workflows-modeling/responses/phase-1/phase-1-mike.md#tech-initiatives-workflow-modeling) identified four **functions** that should be managed by software...

### Functional Aspects
- Document Management (DM)
- Communication (C)
- Project/Task Management (PM)
- Support Desk (SD)

These could be 4 separate systems, 4 facets of one system, or something in between.

## Guide to this requirements table

**Function** Use the preceding by abbreviation in the table below to make clear to which functional area your requirement addresses.

**Requirement** Short name of this requirement for use as a reference in discourse; like a title.

**Description** Elaborate on the requirement as appropriate.

**Criticality** Choose one of the following terms to describe the importance of this requirement in selecting a tool.

- Must Have (**MH**) Critical to the function; choosing a system without this would be a mistake.
- Nice To Have (**NH**) Lagniappe; without it, the system will still be useful, just maybe not as delightful, for example.
- Important (**I**) Near-critical to this functional aspect. One or two of these could be missing in a satisfactory system, but not many.

**Related** If it is importance to draw a relation from this to another requirement, indicate the id(s) here.

**Author** Put your initials here. If you endorse this requirement, but did not write it, feel free to add your initials ***after*** the original author (CSV).
