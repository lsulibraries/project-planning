# Reflections on Workflow Modeling Exercise

### Common themes
* The tool(s) should support the human system, instead of the human system being bound to the tools
  * Multiple tools are involved:
    * Project/Task management
    * Documentation
    * Support desk
    * Communication
* Planning process should include more structure
* Scheduling overall should be more involved - the team should have a better idea of the future beyond the immediate sprint
* Identifying project teams and adapting workflows per project within the team
* Different categories of work get different approaches; work has so far been grouped by:
  * Deadlines: Standard / express (kyle); 
  * Effort: Group / solo (will) or unit / team / partner / solo (kyle);
  * Stakeholder: Libraries / university / external (kyle)
  * Nature: Project / support / maintenance (cara) 
* Roles overall ought to be more clearly defined, see:
  * Project/team/task lead(er); 
  * Front desk / Janus / support desk manager (related, overlapping, not necessarily identical); 
  * Unit head / group leader / project manager; 
  * Domain experts / Listing of responsibility areas
* Facilitating improved communication
  * Internal, with supervisors, among task team and with larger group
  * External, with client - especially in planning and in review

### Possible Conflicts
* We need more tracking for better records vs we spend too much valuable time on tracking & meta
* Increased structure vs maintaining individual agency
* Management responsibility to initiate communication vs individual responsibility to self-report tasks

### Concerns
* Are we good enough at estimating our own time, to start building calendars / schedules?
* It remains unclear how & when "Collections" (scott & cara) + "Developers" (everyone else) acts as one department or two

### Comments
_I recognize it's premature, however, I submit for investigation [Teamwork](https://www.teamwork.com/project-management-software) and [various integrations](https://zapier.com/apps/github/integrations/teamworkpm)_
