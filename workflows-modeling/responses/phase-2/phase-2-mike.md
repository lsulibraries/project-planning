In reading the proposals, I saw that there was a lot of emphasis in defining my role as a project planner, which can both be exciting and a bit anxiety producing. On one level it means to me that I've been pretty much a failure at the role so far, and that the team doesn't trust me anymore when I say that things are going to be better. I've tried to make it so that the work I do will make it easier for everybody else involved to do their jobs better but given the difficulties that most of us are having getting anything done means I have work to do. Therefore I'm looking forward to having a clearly defined role that is fulfilling requirements that is being asked for by the team members, without the worry that the things I'm doing to help are causing undue burden.

I like the ideas proposed by Kyle as far as having clearly defined timelines (the one month and six month timelines). Can I start on that right now? Working that in with Cara's idea of project planning meetings, and a monthly "Scrum of Scrums" or unit planning meeting, seems like an efficient way of proceeding.

Generally, my interpretation of the project planning is that anything with multiple steps might be a project, such as subcomponents of the LDL (rather than the LDL writ large) and that defining who needs to be in on a particular project is important as is the fact that some projects may not need to require extensive use of task management and collaboration tools.

For the results of this meeting, I would like to see something like a diagram or flowchart, and a schedule of meetings/meeting types. I would like to follow up with some document that defines team members areas of responsibility, especially for my own areas, but also for the team members. Of course, I'd also like to follow up with people about project planning and timelines.
