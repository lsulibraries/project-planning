## Project-oriented Planning and Reviews

Aside from the Peak/Waugh submissions, the sum of our models results in at least one strong suggestion: planning per project. While Conlin and Armstrong address this in a more developer-focused fashion, it is clear that both models suggest **more** structure when it comes to task assignment rather than less. Key and I go so far as to say that sprints should also be formed on a per-project basis. And when you introduce asynchronous and overlapping sprints, it should go without saying that you need some kind of calendar/date view to illustrate this information.

    PROS of per-project sprints with a 1-month calendar approach:
    1. Dedicated planning meeting allows room for the nitty-gritty
    2. Less time wasted compared to a unit-wide planning, which involves only a few members being engaged at a time
    3. Introduces a central hub where links to task management and communication can be posted

    CONS of per-project sprints with a 1-month calendar approach:
    1. Calendar needs to be regularly updated and maintained to keep staff informed of overlapping, asynchronous work

## 6-month schedule

Another common theme with at least half the models is the idea that we should no longer be operating in a "fog-of-war" scenario. We need to know how new tasks displace the timeline of current tasks. Once projects have estimated timelines, they need to be put into something that resembles a 6-month calendar schedule. I introduce a term 'schedule delta' to represent the amount of displacement when taking on a new task.

    PROS of 6-month schedule:
    1. Situational awareness when new tasks are introduced

    CONS of 6-month schedule:
    2. Constant updates are needed


## Tiered Task Management
In order to reduce overhead where necessary, a tier system for different scales of tasks needs to be implemented when it comes to task management. 

    PROS of Tiered Task Managment:
    1. Time spent for planning scales accordingly with the project
    2. Less time shopping for the 'ultimate' task management software
    3. Accomodation for collaborative projects

    CONS of Tiered Task Managment:
    1. Links to task management must be maintained on the 1-month and 6-month schedules
    2. Different types of UI for different types of tasks
