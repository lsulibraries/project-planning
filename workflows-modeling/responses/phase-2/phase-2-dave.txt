I would like to add some quick thoughts. First, I saw some consensus on spending more time planning and thinking through requirements early in the process. I also saw some interest in a more structured testing process at the end. I heartily agree with both of these emphases. I would like to remind us the accessibility testing must be included due to LSU's OCR resolution agreement. I would also like to suggest that usability testing with users be included in most, if not all, projects. I can coordinate both of those activities.
