# Tech Initiatives workflow modeling


* Project planning
	* Initiate
		* Project intake
		* Gather requirements
		* Put together project teams
		* Set priorities and plan work at multiple levels
		* Communicate with administration and stakeholders
	* Analyze
		* Create list of deliverables
		* Create definition of ready
		* Create definition of done
		* Create user stories
		* Work with programmers to brainstorm solutions
		* Analyze problems/bugs
			* Create bug reports
		* Identify and procure additional resources
	* Design
		* Working with programmers, define problem approach
		* Planning meeting
			* For simple projects, make work breakdown
	* Construction
		* Identify and remove impediments
		* Update progress, estimations		
	* Testing/Acceptance
		* Working with programmers, test software 
		* Working with programmers, plan releases
			* Communicate with stakeholders
		* Plan project monitoring, analytics
		* Plan project closure with report or retrospective

* Issue management  
	* Enable the opening of ticket by public, staff (internal or external), or team
	* Document new and outstanding issues
	* Create bug reports
	* Document closed issues
		* To research new issues
		* To communicate 
	* Communicate issue status with stakeholders
	* Analyze issues (reports)

* Task management

	* Document closed tasks
	* Be able to see how tasks are related to project or issue
	* Be able to visualize how projects are related to each other  
	* Group together tasks related to epic, user story and features
	* Be able to tie task to resulting code (git commit or branch)
	* Analyze tasks (reports)

* Documentation system 
	* Control access of documentation according to target audience (public, staff or team)
	* Searchable 
	* Version control 
	* Commenting
	* Collaborative editing
	* Ideally, issue and task verbiage and documented code could be easily used for creating human readable documentation
	* Metadata can be attached
	* Maintenance schedules

* Communication system
	* Consolidated contacts
	* Message access  
	* Maintains history and is searchable
	* Information radiators and dashboards

* Integration/testing
	* Develop testing at various levels
	* Easy to make changes to production, with appropriate checks

## Responsibility areas

Workflows could be streamlined by creating and maintaining a document that outlines each team members areas of resposibility. A standard document of this type is a [RACI matrix](https://www.projectsmart.co.uk/how-to-do-raci-charting-and-analysis.php), but it can be simplified. By creating such a thing, some meetings could be avoided, because default behavior when confronted with task with no known "owner", is to ask the whole team.

For example, in LDL who is responsible for these things:

* Collection Management
  * User Management
  	* creation of new accounts
    * training
    * create documentation
    * communicate with collection admins
  * Managing collections
   	* inside/ outside of LSU
    * new vs old collections
  * System Administration
    * monitor performance
    * ensure backups
    * manage release branches
    * develop new features
  * Application Administration
    * content module configuration
    * search configuration
    * metadata display
  * Programming
    * automate manual tasks
    * data transformation
  * Design
  	* User interface
  	* Look and feel

We have responsibility gaps in management in some areas:

* Application adminstration in LDL
* LSU Website - Drupal  
* Intranet  
* Testing and QA
