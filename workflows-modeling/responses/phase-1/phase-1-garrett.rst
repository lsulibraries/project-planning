	An example of this in play:
	===========================

	- GroupLeader92 recognizes being out of the loop on Task483, and so walks to a TaskLeader346 on that task for an update.

	  - TL285 is updating the Task Tracker diligently, so GL8 and GL952 need only read the messages to get a status update.

	    - GL7 asks GL32 about a group of bug reports.  GL32 shares the pretty recent info on a few of them, so now GL7 has a abstract but clear view of those few tasks.  The other tasks are not well understood by either GL, so GL7 makes a point to gather info.  GL7 drops by each team member's office, asking each member for thoughts on these not-yet-understood tasks.  Takeaways from those discussions are boiled down & posted on some Task Tracker.

	      - GL90 feels clear about the current tasks, as well as the potential new tasks.  GL90 prepares a thumbnail sketch of which tasks will get prioritization, and presents the priorities/goals to the group at Sprint Kickoff.  GL90 updates the task tracking board -- deleting expired items, moving back de-prioritized items, moving forward up-prioritized items.
