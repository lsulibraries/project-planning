# Task Modeling for Digital Programs and Services, Part 1  

## Human Systems  

### Project-Based Work  

**Description:** Requires a large number of subtasks to deliver a single, cohesive product. Process may be known or unknown.  
**Examples:** _Add new collection; Develop new feature_  

#### Origin   

* Digital Programs & Services unit
* Digital platform product owner
* LSU Libraries administration
* LSU Libraries department  
* LSU community stakeholder    
* LDC member stakeholder  
* Other external partner    
* Legacy product backlog
* Complex support request    

#### Planning

* Unit head evaluates the priority of the project ranked against competing projects in order to allocate people, time, resources
* Detailed planning is done by the project team at the beginning of the project
* Unit-wide, time-constrained planning meetings cover time allocations to all current projects    

#### General Procedure

1. Unit head consults stakeholders to gather initial requirements  
1. Unit head assembles a project team of domain experts and delivers initial requirements to team  
1. [Project lead initializes project in task manatement system and enters initial project requirements](tool)
1. Project team engages in detailed project planning at kickoff, establishing goals in terms of:
   * Scope   
   * Deliverables  
   * Handoffs
   * Timeline  
   * Staffing
   * Budget
   * Special considerations  
   * Obstacles 
1. [Project lead enters details from planning in task management system](tool)  
1. [Project lead assigns tasks and responsibilities in task management system](tool)
1. Project team members work to complete tasks  
1. [Team members track individual tasks internally in task management system](tool)
   * [Communicate as needed with each other and with stakeholders](task-tool)
   * [Link dependencies using task management system](tool)
   * [Receive notifications when dependencies are resolved](tool)
1. Project team holds regular check in meetings on established schedule per project  
1. Process repeats until project is complete
1. Project lead announces project completion via available communication channels
1. [Depending on nature of project, project lead may create a project history report](tool)

#### Documentation  
* [Tasks are recorded and archived in task management system](tool)  
* [Internal and external communication history is recorded in task management system](tool)  
* [If a new process is established, it is captured in document management system](tool)  
* [Project history is preserved in document management system](tool)

#### Review  
* Project team holds reviews on the schedule established at the beginning of the project
* Completed projects, or significant portions thereof, are demonstrated at unit-wide, time-constrained review meetings

### Support-Based Work  
**Description:** Occurs in response to a request. Involves one or a few tasks. Process may be known or unknown.   
**Examples:** _Bug fixing; User assistance_

#### Origin  
* External - support request from customer
  * Verbal delivery  
  * Email delivery    
  * [Delivery via support desk tool, routed by support desk manager assignment](tool)  
* [Internal problem reporting](tool)  

#### Planning  
* Unpredictable; time is allotted in unit-wide planning
* If support request needs exceed allotted time, prioritization of support vs other work is assessed with unit head
* Complex support tasks may be rerouted as projects, then handled as above  

#### General Procedure
1. _If support request comes outside of ticketing system either (a) directly from reporting customer, or (b) from observation by internal unit member,_ evaluate:
   1. Is the person receiving the request the authorized domain expert for this issue?
      * If no:
          1. [Create support ticket](tool)
          1. [Route to support desk manager](tool)
      * If yes, proceed with next.
   1. Has this issue been resolved in the past?
      * If yes:  
          1. [Refer customer to documentation of solution](tool)      
          1. [Document and close support request](tool)
      * If no, proceed with next.
   1. Is this a simple task that the person receiving the request can handle immediately?
      * If yes:
          1. Complete task
          1. [Inform customer of resolution](tool)  
          1. [Document and close support request](tool)
      * If no:
          1. [Create support ticket](tool)
          1. [Route to support desk manager](tool)
1. [Support desk manager clarifies, categorizes, prioritizes, and assigns support request ticket to domain expert(s)](tool)
1. [If issue is sufficiently complex, upgrade support request to a project and enter into task management tool](tool)
   * Follow procedure above
1. Research solution
1. [Break issue into tasks](tool)
1. Complete task
1. [Track internally](tool)
1. [Provide updates to customer (and potentially to other stakeholders) on a schedule determined by severity level
](tool)
1. Repeat until issue is resolved
1. [Inform customer of resolution](tool)  
1. [Document and close support request](tool)

#### Documentation  
* [Archive of resolved tickets is available for reference](tool)  
* [Internal communication history is recorded](tool)  
* [External communication history is recorded](tool)  
* [Methodology and resolution are recorded and added to archive](tool)  
* [If new process is established, process is recorded in document management tool](tool)  

#### Review   
* Resolved issues are shared at unit-wide review  
* Blocked issues are shared at unit-wide review

### Maintenance-Based Work  
**Description:** Regular, repeating task occurring on a regular cycle. Process is known.    
**Examples:** _Capturing monthly statistics; Reviewing support tickets_

#### Origin  
* [Repeatable time- or calendar-based notification from task management tool](tool)  

#### Planning  
* Predictable; time is allotted in unit-wide planning

#### General Procedure
1. Receive notification that maintenance task is due  
1. [Refer to how-to documentation of established practice](tool)
1. Complete task   
1. [Record results and observations](tool)
1. Report results to stakeholders  

#### Documentation
* [Internal how-to documentation of established practice is available for reference](tool)
* [Results of task and observations are recorded](tool)
  * [May be added to a regular report or other external documentation](tool)

#### Review  
* Results are shared at unit-wide review
