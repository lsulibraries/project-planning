# Tech Initiatives Workflows Modeling

This exercise invited team members to reflect on an idealized workflow as a means to spur discussion of and to build consensus around changes to the existing workflow.

## Phase 1

For the initial meeting on 3/28/2018, each member responding to the following prompt:
>The Tech Initiatives team came up with the following plan for modeling its workflow.


>Monday: Team members will model their personal requirements for what a conceptual system would do for them to enable their own work and for project work. This could take the form of modeling inputs (how do I want to receive work, project requirements, tasks, communication) and outputs (how do I want to record actions, notes, documentation, communication) and/or by listing requirements. We will try to model these things without thinking too much about any particular technical system or software (i.e. Trello, JIRA).

>Tuesday:  Post this work in a team workspace (TBD – maybe Trello, GitHub or Google Docs). Team members should read others docs, and prepare comments.

>Wednesday: (This meeting) The team will meet and begin to draw out a conceptual model to satisfy the posted requirements to the best of our abilities, taking the form of a concept map or mind map.

### Action
In this meeting, everyone presented their document, and the meeting ended with the decision to 'reflect on the reflections'- that is, to each write a new document highlighting common themes and calling out the good ideas of others.

## Phase 2

The official calendar invite prompt for the April 3 writing assignment is as follows:

>We agreed to follow up by reflecting and interpreting the proposals/models. These reflections can be posted on Slack.

>Then we’ll gather together on Tuesday to discuss, and perhaps move toward decisions/future action.

>Here are some suggested questions to facilitate reflection:

>Reflective:

>Where did you find yourself thinking of various parts of your own work?

>What ideas or proposals were the most interesting or exciting?

>What ideas or proposals make you uneasy or skeptical?

>What did you have the most difficulty with?

>Interpretive:

>What relationships do you see between the different ideas?

>Can you identify any common themes? Did something pop up again and again?

>Are any ideas in conflict with each other?

>What questions do these points raise for you?

>What are the implications for how we do our work?

>What work needs to be done before making a final decision about the changes we are recommending?

### Action
In this meeting, we decided to take a Landscape survey of existing projects, including team assignment as a first step towards a first Unit planning meeting. We will meet to discuss this document in the afternoon of April 4. This document is available here at [./Landscape.md](Landscape.md) for each member to self-report their project obligations.

Additionally, we recognized the need to establish requirements for a software system or systems that will support our planning, task management and documentation.
